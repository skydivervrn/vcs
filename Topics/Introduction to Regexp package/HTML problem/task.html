<p>Alarm! Alarm! Emma, the new junior developer of your company, has reached production code (and who's given her access!?)!</p>
<p>She tries to find elements on the web page and starts painting the background of found elements in red, while not finding what she needs! It's terrible! You need to deal with this problem faster! Your team has found out that Emma uses the inline syntax and many elements now have the attribute <code class="java">style</code> with the value <code class="java">background-color:red</code>. You've already split the data into strings, now you need to find this harmful attribute and mark the strings with it by <code class="java">"reject"</code>, marking others with <code class="java">"accept"</code>. You will get strings one by one. Hurry up!</p><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: red;&quot;&gt;I reject your reality, and substitute my own!&lt;/span&gt;</code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">reject</code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
