<p>Your friend Evan is exploring unidirectional channels with you. And he decided to ask you to solve a problem.</p>
<p>In one goroutine, data is sent to the channel, and in the other, data is received from the channel and displayed on the screen.</p>
<p>Evan has already prepared some functions which read the length of data from <code class="java">stdin</code> and generate a data set. Also, he made templates for functions <code class="java">mysteryOne</code> and <code class="java">mysteryTwo</code>. One of them should send data and the other should receive data.</p>
<p>Complete these functions based on directions of arguments channels. In receiver function use <code class="java">fmt.Print()</code> to output numbers without any spaces. In sender function, close the channel.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary"> To make the task more difficult, Evan passes data as an argument to both functions. But this argument is needed only in the sender. Just leave it as it is. </div><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">10</code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">4879849558</code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
