<p>Your friend Harry is already actively using channels in his programs. To support you, he decided to ask you a problem on the direction of the channels.</p>
<p>His program welcomes anyone who enters a name. Harry wrote all the code, but hid the type of channels accepted by the <code class="java">receiver()</code> and <code class="java">sender()</code> functions. Your task is to record the correct type of channels.</p>
<p>The difficulty is that you need to pass a receive-only channel to the receiver function, and send-only to the sender. Harry wrote additional functions <code class="java">isCommon()</code> that will crash the program if you use a bidirectional channel.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary"> You don't need to know how <code class="java">isCommon()</code> function works inside. It simply checks if the channel is bidirectional or not.</div><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Marry</code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Hello, Marry</code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
