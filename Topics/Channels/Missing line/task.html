<p>Edwin has created a Go program to test his knowledge about channels and tried to run it. However, during execution, his program ran into a fatal error!</p>
<p>The cause of the fatal error is that the <code class="java">sender</code> function is missing an essential code line to send a flag that no more values will be transmitted on the channel.</p>
<p>Please help Edwin add the missing line in the <code class="java">sender</code> function to fix his program.</p><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">3</code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">done<br>done<br>done</code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
