<p>At the beginning of the week, we all dream that Friday would come as soon as possible. Let's find out how much time is left until the next Friday! Rather until 16 o'clock next Friday.</p>
<p>As input, you'll get a string with a date and time in <code class="java">RFC3339</code> format. You need to print out one of the next messages:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="java">Relax! It's a weekend day!</code> — if it's Saturday or Sunday;</li>
<li><code class="java">Working week is over!</code> — if it's Friday, but after 16 o'clock;</li>
<li><code class="java">It's %d hours and %d minutes until the next Friday!</code> — if the working week is in full swing.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Tip:</b> Standard layouts of time are included in a time package, for example: <code class="java">time.RFC3339</code>.</p><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">2006-05-12T00:00:00-00:00<br></code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">It&#39;s 16 hours and 0 minutes until the next Friday!<br></code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
