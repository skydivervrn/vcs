<p>Below is a Go program that creates three data writing channels and uses a <code class="language-go">select</code> statement to write data to one of them. Analyze the code and determine in which channel the data will be written.</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    chan1 := make(chan int, 1)
    chan2 := make(chan int, 1)
    chan3 := make(chan int, 1)

    select {
    case chan1 &lt;- 1:
        fmt.Println("The data is written to the first channel.")
    case chan2 &lt;- 2:
        fmt.Println("The data is written to the second channel.")
    case chan3 &lt;- 3:
        fmt.Println("The data is written to the third channel.")
    }

    close(chan1)
    close(chan2)
