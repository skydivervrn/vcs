<p>Xavi has created a Go program that has the <code class="java">FootballPlayer</code> struct that will hold specific data about different football players. It will take the data about players as input.</p>
<p>Now Xavi needs to encode to JSON format the <code class="java">FootballPlayer</code> struct. Unfortunately, he is running late for his morning training session and needs your help to write the additional code to serialize and print the struct!</p>
<p>Below is the code Xavi has written so far:</p><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Ansu Fati 19 Barcelona Forward</code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Ansu&quot;,&quot;lastName&quot;:&quot;Fati&quot;,&quot;age&quot;:19,&quot;team&quot;:&quot;Barcelona&quot;,&quot;position&quot;:&quot;Forward&quot;}</code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
